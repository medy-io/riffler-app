## Welcome to Riffler!

An app to simulate Magic: The Gathering decks.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1.

## Changing Decks

To change decks just add your list to the text area and click submit to get a full visual list of your deck. You can then simulate opening hands, draw cards and apply mulligans.

## Scryfall Card Data

This app uses Scryfall card data and images to display visual views of the users deck. For more detailed documentation on the end point check it out here:
